Toes, thighs, stomach, chest, chin, and nose push up the black plastic. A closed zipper across the top makes sure you can&rsquo;t see inside, keeping the the dead man a mystery. He&rsquo;s made of 961 vertices and 4 textures.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve never used him in a game, it&rsquo;s not really the sort of thing I go for. I browsed his page many times on the Unity Asset Store, always wanting to buy him but never going through with it. Until I finally did the other day. You can find him in the 3D Industrial category. He&rsquo;s from the 19th of January 2017. In that bag all that time. He has three five star ratings.</p><p>Now that I own him he feels like a piece of art I have filed away on my computer, or maybe he&rsquo;s in the cloud. Most of all he reminds me of Gregor Schneider&rsquo;s Toter Mann from 2001, another dead man in another bag, this time a black garbage bag with a pair of legs sticking out wearing pants and socks. Another mystery. Who is that guy?</p><p>The information about Schneider&rsquo;s dead man says he&rsquo;s made of silicone, clothing and a garbage bag. Not dead flesh and blood, then, but if you see him in a gallery there&rsquo;s always that heart-skipping question: is there someone in there?</p><p>If you saw the digital Dead Man in the Bag in a game it would be a different heart-skip of certainty: there&rsquo;s someone in there. Someone dead. Are you seeing him in a game right now? Or are you somewhere else?</p><p>Here in the real world, I know there&rsquo;s not a real person in there, this isn&rsquo;t Tron or The Matrix. But is there <em>anything</em> in there? Most 3D models are filled with emptiness, they don&rsquo;t even have a texture on the inside. Did Maksim Bugrimov, who made this model, put a body inside the body bag to make that body shape? Or not?</p><p>Now that I own him, I can investigate. I can import him into Unity and drop him into a scene and I can float inside the bag with my ghostly camera.</p><p>Even if there&rsquo;s nobody in there, Who is the Dead Man in the Bag? Whose shape is he taking?</p><p>I&rsquo;m looking inside the bag right now as I write this.</p><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-GECKZQ62DH"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-GECKZQ62DH")</script><script src=/js/effects.js></script></body></html>
