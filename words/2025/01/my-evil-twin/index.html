I was about to start work on a recommendation letter for an ex-student who was applying for a professor job at a university in Montréal. I was prepping myself to get into that specific kind of writing mode when I saw the little star icon at the top right and hovered it to find out it was Google&rsquo;s AI.</p><p>Immediately, I had a flash forward of me using Gemini to write this recommendation letter based on the document I&rsquo;d been constructing alongside the ex-student in question. I could have Gemini write it, then edit it, and get the whole thing submitted in&mldr; however long that process takes? I don&rsquo;t actually know. Let&rsquo;s say 20 minutes? I could be kidding myself.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t do that, though. I spent an hour or so writing the letter the old fashioned way, with my brain. I felt pretty strongly that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to receive an AI-written recommendation letter for somebody if I were on a hiring committee, that it would feel like an insult, like their recommender was phoning it in and signalling that they didn&rsquo;t give too much of a shit about the recommendation. That&rsquo;s how I tend to feel when I receive student work clearly written by/&ldquo;with&rdquo; an LLM, same thing for application letters to our graduate program, and so on.</p><p>There are probably exceptions to this – maybe using an LLM helps somebody put together a solid application in a language they aren&rsquo;t quite strong enough in, despite having excellent ideas and knowledge. And maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing, definitely could be. I haven&rsquo;t run into a ton of those cases explicitly, so I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to talk to anyone in that specific situation.</p><p>The thing I was struck by with the Gemini moment was how <em>tempting</em> it was. I feel like I came close and I feel like I dodged a bullet. It reminded me of the compulsion I feel when I play short time control chess games, of just reaching for the sheer satisfaction of this chunk of well-defined time, even when I lose (especially when I lose?). I felt in that moment pretty strongly that if I went down that LLM-writing mode I would be on that road more or less permanently.</p><p>It&rsquo;s that &ldquo;phoning it in&rdquo; feeling that stops me mostly, all the things that would be lost in that time saving act. It seems like it would unavoidably be a diminished thing. It&rsquo;s not just that I think the writing would be trite more or less by definition – hey maybe the writing itself would be fantastic, I really don&rsquo;t know, though I&rsquo;ve seen little evidence of it in the wild. It&rsquo;s more about the loss of the experience of writing, and all the little hooks it has for thought - for thinking about that ex-student and his excellence, to sit with that excellence and to remember conversations with him, things I admire about him, how I would want to put that to make sure the hiring committee would really <em>get it</em>. The world wouldn&rsquo;t end, obviously, but I&rsquo;d be losing something precious, assigning it a lower value than I think it truly deserves - and not just for me, but for everyone who receives it as well, like damming a river (okay, a tiny rivulet).</p><p>I&rsquo;m struggling with how to express all this. I&rsquo;ll try again sometime, because it does seem important. It&rsquo;s something plenty of people are talking about and trying to address. But ultimately I feel like it&rsquo;s about making a decision about what matters, and what can and should be phoned in.</p><p>I think I&rsquo;m newly worried, thanks to that tempting moment with Gemini, my evil twin, that we&rsquo;re going to be fooled by convenience into thinking important things aren&rsquo;t important; that we won&rsquo;t be in the right headspace at the right moment to make the decision with the care it deserves.</p><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-GECKZQ62DH"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-GECKZQ62DH")</script><script src=/js/effects.js></script></body></html>
