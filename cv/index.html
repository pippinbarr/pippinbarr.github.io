Specifically, my dissertation presented a model of videogame play as a distinctive form of interaction with video game software through the lens of human values and value systems.</p><p><strong>M.Sc. (distinction), Computer Science (2002 – 2003)</strong><br>Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand</p><p>My M.Sc. dissertation, <em>User Interface Metaphors in Theory and Practice</em> presented an in-depth study of user-interface metaphor from the perspective of Human-Computer Interaction. This involved the development of a taxonomy based on the work of Lakoff and Johnson in Metaphors We Live By, as well as a semiotic model of user-interface metaphor.</p><p><strong>BA (honours), Philosophy and Computer Science (1997 – 2002)</strong><br>Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand</p><p>My undergraduate and honours degrees were in both Philosophy and Computer Science. The degrees involved a focus on Human-Computer Interaction, but included a substantial software engineering component and some artificial intelligence, along with metaphysics, the philosophy of religion, and ethics.</p><h1 id=publications>Publications</h1><h2 id=books>Books</h2><ol><li>Barr, P. <em>The Stuff Games Are Made Of</em>.
