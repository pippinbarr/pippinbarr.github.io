&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s that thing people write in their blog and then never return again? I feel like Cory Archangel made a project out of it. Someone like that. Anyway, the point is that people start a blog full of determination and wonder at their own bravery, and then quite understandably never return.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so it shall probably be with me, though I at least have the sunk cost of about an hour of working with &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> to try to make it at least somewhat passably useable both in the back end and the front end, so that might give me at least a week of runway? What if I were to add recurring to-dos? What about adding it to my burgeoning habit tracker? How about I make my life miserable as a way to write more? They say the greatest writing comes out of tragedy and sadness, right?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
