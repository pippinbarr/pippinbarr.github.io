&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/dead-man-in-the-bag-79484">Dead Man in the Bag&lt;/a> is a 3D model of a body bag with a body in it. Toes, thighs, stomach, chest, chin, and nose push up the black plastic. A closed zipper across the top makes sure you can&amp;rsquo;t see inside, keeping the the dead man a mystery. He&amp;rsquo;s made of 961 vertices and 4 textures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never used him in a game, it&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of thing I go for. I browsed his page many times on the Unity Asset Store, always wanting to buy him but never going through with it. Until I finally did the other day. You can find him in the 3D Industrial category. He&amp;rsquo;s from the 19th of January 2017. In that bag all that time. He has three five star ratings.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
