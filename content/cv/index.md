# Academic background

**Ph.D., Computer Science (2004 – 2008)**  
Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand

My Ph.D. dissertation, _Video Game Values: Play as Human-Computer Interaction_ involved the close analysis of video games in order to develop a model for thinking about them within Human-Computer Interaction. Specifically, my dissertation presented a model of videogame play as a distinctive form of interaction with video game software through the lens of human values and value systems.

**M.Sc. (distinction), Computer Science (2002 – 2003)**  
Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand

My M.Sc. dissertation, _User Interface Metaphors in Theory and Practice_ presented an in-depth study of user-interface metaphor from the perspective of Human-Computer Interaction. This involved the development of a taxonomy based on the work of Lakoff and Johnson in Metaphors We Live By, as well as a semiotic model of user-interface metaphor.

**BA (honours), Philosophy and Computer Science (1997 – 2002)**  
Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand

My undergraduate and honours degrees were in both Philosophy and Computer Science. The degrees involved a focus on Human-Computer Interaction, but included a substantial software engineering component and some artificial intelligence, along with metaphysics, the philosophy of religion, and ethics.
