Seasons are released one episode per week when each season is ready.

GAMETHING is a series of meditations, reactions, and responses to moments in videogames. They are things that aren't reviews but deep dives on digitally provoked knee-jerks that breathe and melt away.

GAMETHING is sonified videogame experiences.
