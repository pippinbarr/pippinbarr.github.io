description: Tanks shooting tanks! The tanks are upside down now?! Tank on tank action! Why is that cactus floating into the sky?! Shoot that tank! The sky seems to be green?! The shadows have all vanished?! That tank just drove down through the ground?! That oil derrick grew to three times its original size?! What is this, some kind of completely artificial videogame world?!
