title: "The Stuff Games Are Made Of"
date: 2025-05-13
year: 2025
description: "I collaborated with [Devolution](https://devolution.online/) on an exhibition and publication of the games and documentation from my *It is as if...* series. While I wrote the documentation material itself (via my standard process while making the games, all of which is available and linked from each game's page on this site), all the hard work on actually curating, laying out, and generally turning this into books was done by the Devolution team, led by the wonderful Csongor Baranyai."
